INSTRUCTION

Once you are done with Task 3, create a NETLIFY account and deploy your resume.
You can refer to this ( https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/ ) as a guide to getting this done. And once you are done, share the link to your netlify account with the team on slack.
